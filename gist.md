# How to Read Regex!

Regular Expressions are a series of special characters that define a search. These charcters are also known as Regex for short. Regex is a method that will help make sure that a specific string matches the specific requirements for different things. You can use regex for a lot of different things such as a username, passwords, emails, even Hex Values! By using regex your code can be more concise and compact rather than using multiple methods with if statements attached to them!

## Summary

This regex is how to match a Hex Value! In this document I will explain all the parts of the regex as well as the components of regex that are not displayed in this particular one. The example of the matching a Hex Value regex is as shown: `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`. By clicking on the list of components in the Table of Contents, you will be taken to that particular component and there will be an explination of what is happening behind the scenes for that particular component. We will use the Hex Value regex as an example when applicable.

## Regex Components

First lets start of with a list of regex components that are out there. Regex uses several different components that help identify requirements for specific strings. the components of a regex have specific qualities that have a very specific notation. The regex components are: Anchors, Bracket Exprerssions, Quantifiers, Grouping Constructs, The OR Operator, Character Escapes, Character Classes, and Flags. We will go into further detail around what each component does and what it might look like!

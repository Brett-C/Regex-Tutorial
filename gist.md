# How to Read Regex!

Regular Expressions are a series of special characters that define a search. These charcters are also known as Regex for short. Regex is a method that will help make sure that a specific string matches the specific requirements for different things. You can use regex for a lot of different things such as a username, passwords, emails, even Hex Values!
